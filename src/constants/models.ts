      "Llama 4 Scout 17B Instruct (16E) is a mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model developed by Meta, activating 17 billion parameters out of a total of 109B. It supports native multimodal input (text and image) and multilingual output (text and code) across 12 supported languages. Designed for assistant-style interaction and visual reasoning, Scout uses 16 experts per forward pass and features a context length of 10 million tokens, with a training corpus of ~40 trillion tokens." +
      "Built for high efficiency and local or commercial deployment, Llama 4 Scout incorporates early fusion for seamless modality integration. It is instruction-tuned for use in multilingual chat, captioning, and image understanding tasks. Released under the Llama 4 Community License, it was last trained on data up to August 2024 and launched publicly on April 5, 2025.",

      "MAI-DS-R1 is a post-trained variant of DeepSeek-R1 developed by the Microsoft AI team to improve the model’s responsiveness on previously blocked topics while enhancing its safety profile. Built on top of DeepSeek-R1’s reasoning foundation, it integrates 110k examples from the Tulu-3 SFT dataset and 350k internally curated multilingual safety-alignment samples. The model retains strong reasoning, coding, and problem-solving capabilities, while unblocking a wide range of prompts previously restricted in R1." +
      "MAI-DS-R1 demonstrates improved performance on harm mitigation benchmarks and maintains competitive results across general reasoning tasks. It surpasses R1-1776 in satisfaction metrics for blocked queries and reduces leakage in harmful content categories. The model is based on a transformer MoE architecture and is suitable for general-purpose use cases, excluding high-stakes domains such as legal, medical, or autonomous systems.",
